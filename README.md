This is a screenshot of the final step I completed! 

<h2>Description</h2>
This lab was focused on session hijacking that can be used to act as a MITM attack or being able to control your machine. First, I hijacked a session using Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP). Then I intercepted HTTP traffic using bettercap and Hetty. After I did that I then practiced being able to detect session hijack attacks through Wireshark. This lab was pretty easy and wasnâ€™t too hard to grasp.
